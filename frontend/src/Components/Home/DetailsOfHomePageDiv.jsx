                    <br/>
                    <h4>A home automation system typically include a range of features aimed at enhancing convenience, security, and energy efficiency.</h4>
                    <br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One of the key elements is lighting control, allowing users to adjust the intensity and colour of lights in different rooms directly from their smartphone. Smart lighting can adapt to the homeowners routine, or be linked to sensors that respond to other smart devices such as automated blinds. Smart lights are also high energy efficient, as you can control lighting from anywhere with an internet connection, not just from your home lighting controls.</li>
                        <li>Security is another major aspect, with security features like smart locks, security cameras, and a security alarm that can be remotely monitored and controlled. If you're going to invest money in a smart home system, it makes sense to ensure improved security is on your list of priorities. A good security system can help you to feel more at ease in your own home. It can also make those living alone feel better about their home security.</li>
                        <li>These systems often include climate control, enabling homeowners to adjust heating and cooling systems according to their preferences. Smart thermostats are not just great for your wallet, they're also great for the planet. You can switch on your smart thermostat while you are heading home, and switch it off if your plans change. This means no more wasted energy consumption associated with heating an empty home.</li>
                        <li>Entertainment is a key factor for many homeowners. This could include multi room audio system that allows you to play music or your favourite podcasts in any room throughout your home. You might like your home cinema system with your lighting controls and create an automated routine that changes the lighting mood when you start a movie. We have also installed smart TVs beside pools that automatically retract into a secure and tamper proof box when not in use.</li>
                        <li>Another common feature is smart appliances, such as refrigerators, washing machines, and ovens, which can be programmed to perform tasks at specific times. Smart appliances can also speak to the wider home automation system, allowing you to enjoy a connected and truly smart home.</li>
                        <li>Finally, home automation systems also offer energy management features, providing real-time data on energy usage and enabling homeowners to optimise their consumption, leading to lower utility bills.</li>
